For instance, we've got a note-taking app and we want to provide a history feature to the users. This could be solved by creating a history table that contains all previous versions of a record or by using a DBMS that already provides this, such as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/tables/temporal-tables?view=sql-server-ver15">Microsoft SQL Server</a>. However, what if Git was used instead?</p><p>Think about it. Git has refs (tables) that point to commits (DB operations), which contain blobs (records) and information about the previous one (history). In other words, given a table, we can get the most recent state of a record and use it to reach previous versions. That's exactly what we need and what we'll talk about in this post.</p><p>First, let's review a few things about Git.</p><h2>Object database and index</h2><p>As stated in the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain">Pro Git book</a>, Git is a content-addressable filesystem. So, we can store a file and refer to it by the hash of its content. Git has object types, and the one referring to a file is called blob. We cannot represent our whole project solely by blobs, though. We also need the filenames and a way to represent directories, and that's where the tree object is used. A node in a tree contains a name, a filemode (simillar, but not equal to Unix's) and the hash of an object, which can be a blob or another tree.</p><p>In a general Git workflow, the user doesn't create blobs and trees directly. Instead, the user creates a commit, which is another type of object. A commit contains the hash of a tree, an author and a committer, a date for each of them, an optional message and the hash(s) of its parent(s), if it's not the root commit. That's how <code>git log</code> is able to show us a history of commits. The command takes a revision range (e.g. a ref, a commit, a range of commits) and use it to start traversing the commits tree.</p><p>So, if the user doesn't create blobs and trees directly, but commits instead, where does the tree used by the next commit comes from? The answer for that is another data structure managed by Git: the index. The index is located at <code>.git/index</code> and contains a representation of the tree used by the next commit. When <code>git commit</code> is called, a tree is created from the index, then this tree is used to create a commit. The format of the file is specified in <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/technical/index-format.txt">index-format.txt</a>, and it's not in the scope of this post to discuss the specifics of the file.</p><p>The last type of object is the tag. Tags in Git are used to refer to an object by another name. There are two types of tags: lightweight and annotated. The former is just a ref pointing to a commit and doesn't create an object, while the latter is an object containing when the tag was created, who created it and a message. An annotated tag also creates a ref the same way as a lightweight one does.</p><h2>Refs</h2><p>Git has an object database whose items can be addressed by the hash of their contents, but there's still something missing. I mean, how can you know the hash of the last commit or how can Git know what commit to use as the parent of your next one? For that, there are refs. Refs are files that contain the hash of a commit or the name of another ref (symbolic ref) and, apart from a few, are located at <code>.git/refs</code>.</p><p>There are some special refs, including:</p><ul><li><code>refs/heads/*</code>: branches.</li><li><code>refs/remotes/*</code>: remote-tracking branches.</li><li><code>refs/tags/*</code>: tag refs.</li><li><code>HEAD</code>: ref that either points to a branch, making it the current/active branch, or to a commit, in which case the repository would be in <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#_detached_head">detached HEAD state</a>.</li></ul><h2>Bare repositories</h2><p>Up until this point we considered git-related files to be located under the <code>.git</code> directory, and that's generally the case, but we can also create a repository where the <code>.git</code> directory and the one where the working tree is are the same. The working tree is the current state of the directory of your project, but sometimes this tree is not necessary. Sometimes you don't need to be able to edit the files and just want to use this repository as a remote. That's what a bare repository is for.</p><p>A bare repository is created by calling <code>git init --bare</code>, and you can only interact with it by using it as a remote or by using plumbing commands.</p><h2>Plumbing and porcelain</h2><p>You usually interact with a repository by using commands like <code>commit</code>, <code>branch</code>, <code>checkout</code> etc. These commands are called porcelain commands and abstract some operations done by Git so that it's easier to use. The other type of commands is called plumbing, and each of these commands is more focused on performing a specific operation on the filesystem. As an example:</p><h3>Using porcelain commands</h3><pre class="chroma"><span class="c1"># Create the file</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> foo &gt; bar

<span class="c1"># Create an object from the content of the bar file.</span>
<span class="c1"># Add the new object to the index.</span>
git add bar

<span class="c1"># Create a tree from the current index.</span>

<span class="c1"># Update the branch pointed by HEAD to point to the new commit.</span>
git commit -m <span class="s2">&#34;Add bar&#34;</span>
</pre><h3>Using plumbing commands</h3><blockquote><strong>Note</strong>: If you run the commands below, the hashes outputted by <code>git commit-tree</code> won't be the same. Remember, the hash of a commit is based on its content.</blockquote><pre class="chroma"><span class="c1"># Create the file</span>

Note that there's a lot more Git concepts than the ones presented above, so take a look at the <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs">Git reference</a> or the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book">Pro Git book</a> if you want to know more.</p><h2>The DB</h2><p>Let's start by creating the database itself:</p><pre class="chroma">git init --bare
</pre><p>It's a bare repository because there's no point in having two versions of the data. We just need the one stored in the object database. Speaking of which, let's create our first record:</p><pre class="chroma"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s1">&#39;{&#34;name&#34;: &#34;Foo&#34;}&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> git hash-object -w --stdin
<span class="c1"># 11a78487c8c5924f7d05f05ee223898fc6608cf4</span>
</pre><p>We can use the <code>cat-file</code> command to check if the record was saved correctly:</p><pre class="chroma">git cat-file -p 11a78487c8c5924f7d05f05ee223898fc6608cf4
<span class="c1"># {&#34;name&#34;: &#34;Foo&#34;}</span>
</pre><p>The <code>cat-file</code> command provides information about stored objects, like type, size and content. The <code>-p</code> flag asks for the content of the object to be printed based on its type, e.g. print a list of nodes when given a tree or print the raw content given a blob.</p><p>Let's not forget that we've stored the content of the record, but not its name. For that, we need a tree, and the most straightforward way to do that is to create one from the index. So, let's add our new object to the index:</p><pre class="chroma">git update-index --add <span class="se">\
</span><span class="se"></span>  --cacheinfo 100644,11a78487c8c5924f7d05f05ee223898fc6608cf4,data
</pre><p>It was briefly talked about before, but let's now understand where the <code>100644</code> number, the mode of the index entry, comes from. The mode for an index entry is a 32-bit number that starts with the following bits:</p><ul><li>4 bits for the object type.</li><li>3 bits unused.</li><li>9 bits for the Unix permission (only <code>0000</code>, <code>0755</code> and <code>0644</code> are accepted).</li></ul><p>The <code>100644</code> number is an octal number and its binary representation is <code>1000000110100100</code>. It means:</p><ul><li><code>1000</code>: object type that represents a regular file.</li><li><code>000</code>: three unused bits.</li><li><code>110100100</code>: a file than can be read and written by the owner and only read by the group and other users (<code>0644</code> in octal).</li></ul><p>After adding the file to the index, we create a tree from it:</p><pre class="chroma">git write-tree
<span class="c1"># f1db34daa05612f5e50f855715065cf26c929b19</span>
</pre><p>Now we make our first commit. We don't need to check for the existence of a commit pointed by HEAD after dereferencing it because we know this is the first one. If we did, we'd use the version with an <code>if</code> statement presented when talking about plumbing commands.</p><pre class="chroma"><span class="nb">echo</span> -n <span class="p">|</span> <span class="nv">GIT_AUTHOR_NAME</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&#34;Foo&#34;</span> <span class="se">\

</pre><p>This time, we used <code>commit-tree</code> with environment variables. These variables are used to tell <code>commit-tree</code> to not use the default values when building the commit, making the outputted hash the same no matter where or when the command is run. Instead of passing a message using <code>-m</code>, we passed it through stdin by piping the output of the <code>echo -n</code> command with <code>git commit-tree</code>. Also, we're not passing any argument to <code>echo</code> to make this commit have an empty message, and <code>-n</code> tells the command to not append a <code>\n</code> character to the output. To be sure, let's check if the commit has indeed an empty message by doing a <code>hexdump</code> of the commit object's file.</p><pre class="chroma">pigz -c -z -d objects/38/3f6fb5445bd2dd84b5c2b52d80565b8973d111 <span class="p">|</span> hexdump -C

</pre><p>Any object file in Git starts with a header containing the object type (<code>commit</code>), a space, the size of the object in bytes (<code>134</code>) and a <code>NUL</code> character (the <code>.</code> after <code>134</code>). The concatenation of the header and the object's content is then compressed by zlib and that's what ends up being stored in the file and why we piped <code>pigz</code> to <code>hexdump</code>. After the committer's date, there are two <code>.</code> characters. If you look at the hex table, you'll see that both of these dots refer to the same hexadecimal number, <code>0x0a</code>, which represents the <code>\n</code> (new line, line feed) character. The commit message is placed after these two line feeds and, as you can see, there's nothing after them in our newly-created commit.</p><p>The last step is to create the ref:</p><pre class="chroma">git update-ref refs/note1 383f6fb5445bd2dd84b5c2b52d80565b8973d111
</pre><p>And that's it for the database. If we were to create a new version for <code>note1</code>, we'd do the same steps, but would also pass a parent commit when running <code>commit-tree</code>.</p><h2>About libgit2</h2><p>It was not talked about in this post how to integrate the database with the note-taking app. This is because we wouldn't use Git commands for that, but a Git implementation, such as <a href="https://libgit2.org/">libgit2</a>, instead. Using commands would be very error-prone because of, among other things, having to parse the output of a command like <code>git log</code>. I've started a project that uses <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/git2go">git2go</a>, a Go package that provides bindings for libgit2, and this will be the subject of the next post.</p></div><footer class="post-footer"><a href="https://github.com/efreitasn/efreitasn.dev/blob/master/content/posts/git-db/content_en.md">View on GitHub</a></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><nav class="footer-nav"><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/efreitasn/efreitasn.dev">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/posts/about">About</a></li><li><a href="/pt-BR/posts/git-db">Português do Brasil</a></li></ul></nav></footer></div></body></html>
