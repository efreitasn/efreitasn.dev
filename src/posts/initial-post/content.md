Ok, that's my first post. Yes, that's something that I've been wanting to write/say for quite some time now.

A personal blog was one of my goals for 2019, and, after over two months, I was finally able to see it through. Surely, there's still a huge room for improvement, but I know I'll get there. To name a few to-dos: a dark mode, PWA support and a search bar. However, the most important thing is: it's finally online and I like the result.

Actually, having a personal blog is part of a bigger goal: sharing knowledge. I mean, this is one of the coolest things a person could do. **It doesn't matter if it's some groundbreaking idea or something simple. What matters is that this knowledge will eventually be valuable to someone.** Even if it turns out to not be valuable to anyone that comes across it, which is very difficult to happen, it'll still be valuable to you down the road when you need to recap what you've already learned. I learned most of what I know because there were posts, talks, open source projects, documentations, people that were willing to spend their time answering questions in forums, and the list goes on.

Oh, that's something important: one of the best ways to learn something, at least for me, is to teach/share what I know about it. That's also one of the reasons I started this blog. **Explaining what you know to others is a very powerful tool in your own learning proccess.**

Just to summarize this short hopefully-not-first-and-only post of mine: **share your knowledge.** It feels good, it's good to a lot of people and you end up learning even more.

'til next post.
